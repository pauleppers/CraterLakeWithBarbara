				Hi! My name is <strong>Paul Eppers</strong>. My wife and I are very sporty and currently
				we bike together in order to spend time in the outdoors, keep fit, and not go crazy from Covid. 
				Last year we biked much more in order to get ready for our vacation, Cycle Oregon. Last 
				September we spent 7 days and bike 450 miles in Oregon with almost 2,000 other bikers
				from around the country and around the world. </p>

			<p>Currently I am in process of a carrear change, switching from engineering into data 
			science. After spending over 20 years in industry I realized I really enjoy creating 
			programs, my creative side, and working with data, my nerdy side. Fall of 2020 I am taking 
			two class (JavaScript and Business Analytics) at Wake Tech Community College and a Data 
			Visualization Bootcamp at UNC-Chapel Hill.S</p>
